The notebook starts with the design of a linear regression model that can be used to predict profits for a city based on its population. It shows how to visualize the relationship between population and profit, defines a linear model (`profit = w * population + b`), and uses gradient descent to find the best fit by minimizing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between predicted and actual profits. After the initialization of the parameters, the model iteratively updated the same to best fit the data, and finally an optimized model was used to predict profits for cities having a population of 35,000 and 70,000 people with an approximated profit of $27,480.68 and $45,593.73, respectively.
